The model is built using [mention the machine learning framework or libraries used, e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.], and the dataset is sourced from [mention the dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. The aim is to provide accurate predictions that can help insurance companies asDataset
